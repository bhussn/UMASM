#   Purpose: Initalizes registers and calls main
#
#   Calling Conventions: 
#                    - r1 = 0 
#                    - r6 and r7 are temps 
#                    - r2 holds the stack pointer
#                    - r1 holds the return address and return result
#

.temps r6, r7
.zero r0

.section init
# start
#   purpose: initializes r0 as 0, r2 as the stack-pointer, and calls main
#   args:       none
#   returns:    none
#   expects:    to be called after all other initialization
#   registers:  r0 = 0, r2 = stack pointer, r1 = main address
start:
    r0 := 0
    r2 := endstack
    goto main linking r1
